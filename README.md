# Mental Health Resources
I was speaking to a SQL Community member, [Dale Hirt](https://twitter.com/DaleHirt), a few months back and came up with the idea of putting up a mental health resource page on my blog and well I procrasinated.  Then today I started and got the idea to host on GitHub instead so others could add things they find valuable.  More to come this is just my first stab so stay posted.

I ask if you are going to contribute to this list to if it something that doesn't fall under something a community member has contribute you describe it's value.

## Training
- [Mental Health First Aid](https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org/) - I told [Rob Farley](https://twitter.com/rob_farley) this has to be his country's, Australia, greatest contribution to helping those with mental illness.  So if you ever wanted to know how to help some in crisis look at getting mental health first aid certified.  I have it both for youth and adults.
